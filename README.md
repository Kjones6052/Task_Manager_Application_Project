# **Hello, World**

This repository contains the files for my project titled 'Task Manager Application Project'.

Overview:

This project was designed to represent a web based Task Manager Application. The application will allow users to
register a new user account, log into a user account, view a task dashboard with options to create, search for details, 
or complete a task. The application also features a home screen or landing page with information about the features of
the application. 

Details about the project:

I started with a basic HTML document that includes the same header at the top of each page, navigation bar on top and 
bottom of each page, and body styling for each page. This was intended to keep a uniform style for each page with very few
changes between pages. One major change between pages can be found on the 'authenticate.html' and 'register.html' files.
The changes in these 2 web pages is the background color of the forms to register a new user account and to log into a 
user account. These 2 forms share a change in background color to differentiate forms between forms for user accounts and 
forms for user actions within the app. 

I used Bootstrap on every section, whether its typography, styling, or structure, each individual page utilizes Bootstrap 
classes and utilities. I also included a small css file to make adjustments to a couple of specific elements I wanted to 
change. These changes include text shadow effect for the main header on each page, and the button hover effects applied to 
all buttons.
